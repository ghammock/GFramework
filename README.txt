================================================================================

I initially developed this CMS for a project for my CSCI 5600 Databases class
at MTSU.  The framework supports user authentication, administration, and
content management.  This is a work in progress, so please feel free to report
bugs and issues.

In the current version, passwords are hashed and salted.  I do plan to implement
sCrypt in a future version.

                               Future Work
================================================================================

Implementation of a contained sCrypt (or other PBKDF) depending on how much time
I have available.
