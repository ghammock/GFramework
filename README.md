__GFramework__ - A PHP/JS based Content Management System

__Author__: Gary Hammock, PE

#Description

I initially developed this CMS for a project for my CSCI 5600 Databases class at
MTSU.  The framework supports user authentication, administration, and content
management.  This is a work in progress, so please feel free to report bugs and
issues.

#Future Work

Implementation of a contained sCrypt (or other PBKDF) depending on how much time
I have available.
